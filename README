A procedurally generated puzzle game that fits inside the Master Boot Record of 
a drive.

When installed to a bootable drive, it will boot the computer directly into the 
game. No files or partitions on the disk are modified, and the game is not 
visible on the disk when inside an operating system.

Builds and installs using JWASM and GNU Make on Linux.

Install at your own risk! Do not install or use on drives or computers you do 
not own! Not guaranteed to work on all computers. It is strongly discouraged to 
install to an internal drive or one that may be used to boot or install an 
operating system at any time in the future. Change the "install_drive" path in 
the Makefile to point to a connected and unmounted usb drive before running 
`make install` as root. This program is distributed without any warranty, see 
COPYING for details.

If a debugging build of dosbox is available as `dosbox-debug`, `make run` will 
attempt to use it to run the game without modifying any disks. 

This game is written for a 16-bit Legacy BIOS environment and will probably not 
work on UEFI systems. Mid-2000s to early 2010s desktops and laptops seem to 
work. It is also intended for classic MBR disks, and may corrupt formats 
developed for 2TB+ disks.


How To Play:
Use the arrow keys to move the smiley face. Collect all the diamonds without 
being crushed by falling boulders or diamonds. When all the diamonds are 
collected, go to the flashing exit. Press 'S' to skip a level if you or a 
diamond become trapped.
